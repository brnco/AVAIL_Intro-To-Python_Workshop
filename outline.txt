1. Intro - Setup - Python Basics

Intro to me and Python - 5m

Rough History of Python + context now - 5m

Python Versioning, Text Editors - 5m
used to be easy to set up, there was 1 version
now the setup can be really frustrating

Invoking Python, Interactive vs Scripts - 5m
interactive shell is like CLI but with Python syntax
Hello, World!

Modules / Packages - 10m
Python is extensible and the packaging ecosystem is one of the reasons it's so popular
PSL is everything that you don't have to install or import
to install packages you need pip
those pkgs may themselves have dependencies (of other pkgs)
you can remove pkgs with pip
DEMO PyPI
DEMO GitHub

Functions, variables, errors, getting help - 15mins
variables are the backbone of any programming language, the real power of computing
it's an abstraction of a value, a human-readable pointer to a location in memory
variables can be overwritten
they can change types

Functions are the basic structure of code
they separate individual tasks - e.g. on a login page, there's a function to laod the page, another to check your password, and another to direct you to the homepage after login, and another to prompt you to to reset your password - all different functions, potentially
they accept arguments, order is important or they can be named
they return results
DEMO - def hello_world() return hello_word

Errors detail what went wrong with the execution of code
so the way this works is: you write code in your text editor, you move to terminal and run code, you get an error (usually)
you'll get 90% errors, it's  a discipline of failure mostly
you can write your own error types but Python provides a bunch that are really helpful
DEMO - generate each of the errors

One Example

you get a hard drive back from a vendor and you need to do stuff to what's on the drive

tasks include:
list the file name of a file
list the file extension of a file
list the sample rate/ bit depth of a file
verify the hash of a file against a manifest
verify that a file in the manifest is on the drive
